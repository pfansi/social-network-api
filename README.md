## Description:

This project is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. We will use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. Additionally a native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps will be used.
